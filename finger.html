    <div>Ever heard about fingerprints in computer science? It's honestly really helpful when it comes to website security. When it comes down to it, most websites you visit are HTTP websites. HTTPS is basically HTTP but the s stands for secure. This allows you to have a secure connection to something and can't be hacked. However, this is not always the case anymore. There are many possible attacks that can be done to HTTP however there are a couple things that you can do in order to protect yourself.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      To get a better understanding of why exactly HTTP is important, we must first understand what it even is. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is basically a protocol in order to load web pages using hypertext links. In other words: no HTTP = no website. Another primary purpose of an HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer protocol with security) is to protect the integrity of the connection between the user's computer and the website. HTTPS obfuscates a user's IP address in order to protect themselves against any DDOS attacks or other attacks known. This system is known as HTTPS proxy alliance. Where the user goes onto the website with say an Ip address of 1.1.1.1, and the HTTPS proxy makes their new Ip address 96.96.96. This allows the website to not have any private data leaked from the user. This allows internet security to be enabled, however there are some exceptions.

      Unfortunately, in the world of technology hackers could intercept HTTPS connections. MITM (Man in the middle) attacks are basically spyware in a way. An attacker eavesdropping in between connections. For example, in those Mission Impossible movies, someone's phone getting “tapped” is a MITM. Say Ethan Hunt and Benjy are talking about how to diffuse a bomb underwater. A MITM attacker could be listening in on their conversation without them even knowing. Say Benjy says “The bomb is 500 meters from the coast of flordia,” the attacker can hear that and Benjy would have no idea. The risk behind this is that he could alert Solomon Lane about the infiltration and the entire plan could be compromised. In reality, if the President of the United States is giving launch codes away to the VP, a Russian KGB hacker could take the launch codes and nuke america.

      <br>
      Furthermore, there is something called an SSL. An SSL certificate is basically a certificate that authenticates a website's identity and allows an encrypted connection. Why is this important? Because it protects a website from having any spyware on it. It creates a “hash”, which is just a bunch of computer data that is encrypted. With these hashes, a user can safely navigate through websites without having to worry too much about attacks. However, SSL can be intercepted. To solve this problem, simply just use trusted web browsers and visit trusted sites. Do not go to some random foreign country and enter your credit card details. You will get scammed. SSL interception can be detected by using firefox as a browser. Firefox can see a faked security certificate so it can essentially help with security user end and website end. This brings up to detection for false positives or false negatives
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      A false positive is basically when a test result thinks that something is present when it is not. For example if there is any malware inside of a website or anything malicious, it will typically trigger on a good browser. However, sometimes there is nothing malicious on a website but due to its weird certification google may block it just in case. A false negative is the opposite. A false negative is when there is something malicious but it says it's safe. For example, say someone emails you an exe file and says to run it. On virus total it says that there is nothing malicious, but the trojan is so heavily encrypted that there in reality is something.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Finally, this brings us to the last point: Whether the school or government should have access to eavesdrop on your communication. I personally do not think that it should not be a thing in order to protect privacy for some of us. I don't think it is fair that someone is spying on something that we would not want to share.
