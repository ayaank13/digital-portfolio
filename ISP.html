<h1>Concept</h1>
<p>The basic concept of our ISP was to have a text based game where the user would input responsed and based off of that the storyline would change. It is kind of like a tree branch. It starts off with one singular question and based off of that the end result of the game branches off more and more based off of the responses.</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>At the time of the ISP, I originally started playing a video game called Detroit Become Human. It is about an AI robot with a realistic body living in the free world where there is a discrimination going on between humans and AIs. It is a choose your own adventure game that was honeslty one of my favorite single player games apart from Skyrim. The original idea for my ISP was to have a simple pong game, however we already did a Merlin Mission similar to this so that would be pointless. So after I finished playing that game, I changed my entire ISP to be based off of that. The original storyline was a little difficult to think of but also at the time that my original pong game had failed, I was really into sci-fi horror movies. That saturday night around like 11pm I started scrolling through netflix and found a movie to just binge till about 1-2ish in the morning. Then I kind of took the storyline of that movie and implemented it in my own ISP game.</p>

<h1>Segments of code</h1>

<p>This segment of code is basically me making the interactive textboxes based on your response. So if you entered E then you would have a specific response which changes which branch your going down which also means it changes your ending. The ending is entirely dependent on your responses.</p>

<p>Over here, this is explaining what happens if someone were to put an incorrect response. For example say the message says to type x for this outcome and y for this outcome and they type z, it gives them an error message.

  <h1>What in CSI did I learn in order to create this?</h1>
<p>The primary thing that absolutley carried me through this was just understanding the syntax of swift. Swift is kind of similar to python and well this language can be utilized in many different ways. Learning the basics such as what a class is what a function is allowed me to manipulate code into doing the things I needed it to do. For example having multiple render functions underneath a class and being able to easily refer back to it in case I needed to render more objects. In addition, another thing was learning how scopes work. Scopes basically made my life so much easier by organizing everything to where I can read and find if I need to change something instead of just throwing everything randomly in a big mess and hoping I find it.
