    <h1>About Ayaan Kashyap</h1>
    <p>My name is Ayaan Kashyap. I play Ice Hockey for Allen and I enjoy lifting as well as playing video games. During each school day, I like to day trade by buying option contracts in order to make some side money. Overall I have lost about 80% of my entire portfolio however I still have a about 600$ left that I trade with. I take my academics seriously because I want to thrive when I am in my 20's.

      Why is it important to have a portfolio you may ask? Well the most fundemental thing in the workforce and even colleges is experience. If a Job or even a College sees that you have some experience with a computer science backround ( The entire point why I am making this), then your chances of admission will increase. They look for people who are worthy by looking at previous work. If you are worthy, you need to have some publicity on your projects. No college or Job would admit you in if you have no experience or anything that takes their breath away. Having this portfolio is one of the best things to show colleges and show off your programming skills. The entire goal here is not to be average. Be more than average. Be better than average. Be better than the better at being average.
